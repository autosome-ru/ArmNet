[`CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION`]

Here we present a hybrid transformer and convolutional network for predicting RNA reactivities based on data provided in [Stanford Ribonanza RNA Folding](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding) competition.
<br>

Our approach took the [first place](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding/discussion/460121) in the Ribonanza competition. In this repository we present our post-competition model based on methods used by other contestants and our insights.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èTraining the model

First, download data from [Stanford Ribonanza RNA Folding](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/stanford-ribonanza-rna-folding/data) competition and then specify data paths in config file. If you want to train model which takes BPPMs (base pair probability matrices) as input you should do the fllowing:

* for train matrices merge all matrices in file named "joined.mmap" using `numpy.memmap` and save array of corresponding sequence IDs in file named "index.ind" using `numpy.save`
* for test matrices save individual matrices using `numpy.save` in separate directory; these files should be named as "SEQUENCE_ID.npy", SEQUENCE_ID is corresponding sequence's ID

For each sequence in train and test datasets we predicted BPPM using [EternaFold](https://github.com/eternagame/EternaFold) package.

All data paths along with main model parameters are specified in **config.json** file. Architectural parameters can be changed only through config.json, whereas training parameters can be changed as command line arguments. By default, in each run all scripts save config-file with all parameters used.

The examples of running training script:
```
python train.py -c CONFIG.json

# Output directory should be specified as command line argument; be default all output files are saved in directory "results"
python train.py -c CONFIG.json --out_dir_path ./chosen_dir

# Training parameters can be conviniently changed in command line
# Values specified in command line will be used instead of corresponding values from config-file
# By default, all changes are saved in separate config file in ouput directory 
python train.py -c CONFIG.json --out_dir_path ./chosen_dir --device 0 --max_lr 0.002
```

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èTesting on competition data
Analogously to training script, `test.py` uses config file, but it requires model weights specified in `--pretrained_model_weights` argument. This script generates contest submission.

The examples of running testing script:
```
python test.py -c CONFIG.json --pretrained_model_weights ./results/sgd_run/model.pth
```

To convert submisiion file to dataframe of format equivalent to training dataset you can use `to_train_format` function from `test_utils.py`
